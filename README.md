I've Always wanted to make an application that models how some algorithms work! So far this includes a visual representation of how Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and the A* algorithm work. The plan is to continue adding to the functionality and continuously make it better.  This also served as a learning process for me for me to get some hands on experience with javascript and some react. I think the result turned out pretty good!
